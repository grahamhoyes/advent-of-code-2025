# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), done in Rust.

Each day has two parts, in `dayXY/src/part_1.rs` and `dayXY/src/part_2.rs`. Sometimes the two parts are very similar
with only minor modifications, other times the changes are more invasive. I sometimes come back to solutions after
they're completed to optimize them or to apply something new that I've learned so I can remember it in the future;
you can view the original solution for each day in the git history.

## CLI

A basic CLI is provided in [aoc.sh](aoc.sh) for configuring project directories. The first time the script is run, it
will ask for a session token which gets stored in `.env` (used to fetch inputs). The session cookie can be found by
logging in to https://adventofcode.com/ and using the dev tools to either view the request headers when loading a page,
or by viewing cookies directly under the Application/Storage section of the dev tools.

To create project directories for a new day, run eg:

```bash
./aoc.sh new 1
```

Inputs are `.gitignore`'d. To download inputs for an existing day's projects, run eg:

```bash
./aoc.sh download 1
```

Examples aren't automatically downloaded, so you'll have to copy those manually into `example.txt`.

## Running a Day

The code for a day is run through cargo like normal, there's nothing special tying the projects together.

```bash
./aoc.sh downlad 12

cd day12

# For example input
cargo run -- 1 example

# For actual input
cargo run -- 1 input

# Part 2
cargo run -- 2 input
```
